  <b>Emporium is a REST API for an E-commerce that uses Stripe as a payment gateway and allows creating resources such as products and discount coupons. Additionally, the project was developed following the principles of <a href=https://medium.com/@gabrielfernandeslemos/clean-architecture-uma-abordagem-baseada-em-princ%C3%ADpios-bf9866da1f9c>Clean Architecture</a> and with the best and most up-to-date practices to ensure the integrity of sensitive data.</b>

<h2 id="documentation">üìÑ Access documentation</h2>

The project is hosted on a cloud service. Therefore, you can access its [documentation](https://emporium-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html#/) developed through Swagger UI without the need to run it locally.

<h2 id="run">‚öôÔ∏è Run project</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Stripe Account](https://stripe.com/)

<h3>Cloning</h3>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrieudev/emporium.git
```

<h3>Environment Variables</h3>

To run the application, you will need to set two environment variables related to the Stripe service: [Secret Key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) and [Stripe Webhook Secret](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).

Note: The event type chosen for creating the Stripe webhook secret should be `checkout.session.completed`.

<h3>Starting</h3>

Run the following commands, replacing the two variables:

```bash
cd emporium
STRIPE_KEY=<secret_key> STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<webhook_secret> PROFILE=dev docker compose up -d
```

<h2>üîÅ How to use</h2>

1. Create a user with `POST /users/signup`

2. Log in with `POST /auth/signin` and copy the `accessToken` value.

3. Go to `Authorize` in the top field of the Swagger interface and enter the copied value. This way, all requests will automatically include the access token.

4. Get your cart with `GET /carts`, search for a product with `GET /products`, and then create a new cart item with `POST /cart-items`.

5. Get your cart again with `GET /carts`, now updated, and create a new order with `POST /orders`.

6. Optionally, you can add a discount coupon to your order. Just create a discount with `POST /discounts` using the following test coupon with a 10% discount:

```bash
{
  "id": "d8ccd30a-8cca-4e09-bdfb-8729c117c033",
  "code": "ABC123",
  "percentOff": 10,
  "minOrderValue": 100,
  "validFrom": "2025-01-20T18:55:12.199",
  "validUntil": "2027-01-20T18:52:12.199",
  "usageLimit": 100,
  "usageCount": 0,
  "stripeId": "wrS5mdCc",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-20T18:54:52.932574701",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-20T18:54:52.932639325"
}
```

If you didn't copy your order, you can retrieve it with `GET /orders` by inserting your user ID. If you don't know your user ID, you can get it with `GET /users/me`.

Note: The coupon will only be usable for orders with a minimum value of 100 and until 01/20/2027.

7. Obtain the payment link for your order with `GET /orders/{UUID}/payment-link` and access it.

8. Fill in the required personal fields (it is recommended to use fictitious information). For the payment method, enter the following test card:

```yaml
Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiration date: 01/30
Security code: 420
```

Finally, you will be redirected back to the Swagger interface. Now, your cart will be empty, and your order will be updated with the information you entered during payment.
